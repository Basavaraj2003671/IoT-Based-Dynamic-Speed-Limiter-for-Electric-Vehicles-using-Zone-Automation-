# IoT-Based-Dynamic-Speed-Limiter-for-Electric-Vehicles-using-Zone-Automation-
This project implements an automatic EV speed-limiting system based on zone automation using nRF24L01 RF modules and Arduino. A transmitter placed in restricted zones (ex: School Zone) sends a signal to the EV’s receiver unit. Upon detection, the EV automatically reduces its speed to a safe limit, alerts the driver, and prevents speeding inside the zone. When the vehicle exits the zone, normal speed control is restored.

Features
